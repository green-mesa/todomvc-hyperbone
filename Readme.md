# todomvc-hyperbone

  Todo application made with hyperbone.

  This is a work in progress! This TodoMVC, it turns out, is a pretty good smoke test for a framework.

  Additional warning: Doing this project has highlighted a number of issues with Hyperbone that require fixes to the modules. The build in this repo has upgraded versions of View and Model but these represent a spike, and need extensive test coverage before they can be integrated into the main branches.
